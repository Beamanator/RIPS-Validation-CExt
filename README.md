# RIPS-Validation-CExt
Chrome Extension that adds some special features to RIPS

Thus far (as of today) we've added Phone number validation, UNHCR number validation (4 or 5 formats) and Date of birth validation.

This extension has also manipulated the RIPS view a bit, and now tracks some user login occurrances just for fun.
